Women are more prone to back pain and injury during this time due to a shift in center of gravity, carrying extra weight, and looser more unstable ligaments. Through controlled exercises, this gentle but effective method will help you to strengthen postural and pelvic floor muscles that will aid in labor and recovery!",
